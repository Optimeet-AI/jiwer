This file implements methods for calculating a number of similarity error
measures between a ground-truth sentence and a hypothesis sentence, which are
commonly used to measure the performance for an automatic speech recognition
(ASR) system.

The following measures are implemented:

- Word Error Rate (WER), which is where this library got its name from. This
  has has long been (and arguably still is) the de facto standard for computing
  ASR performance.
- Match Error Rate (MER)
- Word Information Lost (WIL)
- Word Information Preserved (WIP)

    multiple sentences which need to be evaluated independently. Each word in a
    sentence is separated by one or more spaces. A sentence is not expected to end
    with a specific token (such as a `.`). If the ASR system does delimit sentences
    it is expected that these tokens are filtered out.

    steps are required and necessary in order to compute the measures.

    1) The start and end of a string are stripped of white-space symbols
    2) Contiguous spaces (e.g `   `) are reduced to a single space (e.g ` `)
    3) A sentence (with a single space (` `) between words) is reduced to a
       list of words

    Any non-default transformation is required to reduce the input to at least
